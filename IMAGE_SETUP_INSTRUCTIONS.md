# 📸 Image Setup Instructions for Karthi's Birthday Website

## 🎯 Overview
This guide will help you integrate all the beautiful images from your Documents folder into Karthi's birthday website, creating both a main gallery and a memory gallery system.

## 📁 Step 1: Create Folder Structure

Create the following folders in your project directory:

```
Birthday Karthi/
├── images/
│   ├── main-gallery/          # All photos for the main gallery
│   ├── memory-photos/         # Special photos for the shooting game
│   ├── profile/              # Profile photo of Karthi
│   └── backgrounds/          # Optional background images
├── setup-images.html         # Image setup helper (already created)
├── main-gallery.html         # Main photo gallery (already created)
├── gallery.html              # Memory gallery from game (already exists)
└── ... (other files)
```

## 📷 Step 2: Copy Your Images

### From Documents Folder:
1. **Open your Documents folder**
2. **Select all the photos** you want to include
3. **Copy them to the appropriate folders:**
   - **Main Gallery**: Copy 15-20 best photos to `images/main-gallery/`
   - **Memory Photos**: Copy 10 special photos to `images/memory-photos/`
   - **Profile Photo**: Copy 1 best photo of Karthi to `images/profile/`

### Recommended Image Organization:
- **Main Gallery**: All general photos, memories, celebrations, friends, family
- **Memory Photos**: Special photos that will be unlocked in the shooting game
- **Profile**: One high-quality photo of Karthi for the main page

## 🔧 Step 3: Use the Image Setup Helper

1. **Open `setup-images.html`** in your browser
2. **Click "Choose Files"** and select all your copied images
3. **Preview** all images to make sure they look good
4. **Click "Generate Image List"** to create the code
5. **Copy the generated code** for the next step

## ⚙️ Step 4: Update the Website Files

### A. Update Main Gallery Script
1. **Open `main-gallery-script.js`**
2. **Find the `loadPhotosFromDocuments()` method**
3. **Replace the sample images array** with your generated code
4. **Update image paths** to point to your actual files

Example:
```javascript
this.images.mainGallery = [
    {
        id: 1,
        url: 'images/main-gallery/karthi-birthday-2024.jpg',
        title: 'Birthday Celebration 2024',
        description: 'Amazing birthday party with friends',
        category: 'celebrations',
        date: '2024-12-01'
    },
    // ... more images
];
```

### B. Update Memory Gallery Script
1. **Open `gallery-script.js`**
2. **Find the constructor method**
3. **Update the `documentsImages` array** with your memory photos:

```javascript
this.documentsImages = [
    'images/memory-photos/memory1.jpg',
    'images/memory-photos/memory2.jpg',
    'images/memory-photos/memory3.jpg',
    // ... up to 10 photos
];
```

### C. Update Profile Image
1. **Open `main.html`**
2. **Find the profile image section** (around line 337)
3. **Replace the placeholder URL** with your profile image:

```html
<img src="images/profile/karthi-profile.jpg"
     alt="Karthi K"
     class="profile-image"
     data-aos="zoom-in"
     data-aos-delay="600">
```

## 🎮 Step 5: Update Game Integration

### Update Game Script for Memory Photos
1. **Open `game-script.js`**
2. **Find the `memoryPhotos` array**
3. **Replace with your memory photos:**

```javascript
const memoryPhotos = [
    'images/memory-photos/memory1.jpg',
    'images/memory-photos/memory2.jpg',
    // ... your memory photos
];
```

## 🧪 Step 6: Test Everything

### Test Checklist:
- [ ] **Main Gallery** (`main-gallery.html`) shows all your photos
- [ ] **Memory Gallery** (`gallery.html`) works with the game
- [ ] **Profile Image** appears correctly on main page
- [ ] **Image filtering** works in main gallery
- [ ] **Lightbox** opens images properly
- [ ] **Mobile responsiveness** looks good
- [ ] **Game integration** unlocks memory photos correctly

## 🔍 Step 7: Optimize Images (Optional)

For better performance:
1. **Resize large images** to max 1200px width
2. **Compress images** to reduce file size
3. **Use WebP format** for modern browsers (optional)
4. **Add loading="lazy"** attribute for better performance

## 🎨 Step 8: Customize Categories

You can customize image categories in `main-gallery-script.js`:

```javascript
this.imageCategories = {
    'memories': '💭 Beautiful Memories',
    'celebrations': '🎉 Birthday Celebrations', 
    'friends': '👥 Amazing Friends',
    'family': '👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Loving Family',
    'sports': '🏓 Table Tennis Champion',
    'achievements': '🏆 Great Achievements'
};
```

## 🚀 Step 9: Launch Your Website

1. **Open `index.html`** in your browser
2. **Test the complete flow:**
   - Gift box → Main page → Main gallery
   - Gift box → Main page → Game → Memory gallery
   - All navigation links work correctly
